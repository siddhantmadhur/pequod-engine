/**
* position.hh 
* 
* A physics based component for the ECS
* The way it is supposed to work is that there is a 
* raw_position that is set per tick
* 
* The issue with that is that since theres only 20
* ticks in a second, the game effectively looks like
* 20fps if you render the position
*
* So the position value is interpolated to play
* between those ticks and thus looks smooth
